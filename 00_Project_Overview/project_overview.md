# Customer Churn Intelligence Project --- Project Overview

## Executive Summary

This project presents a complete end-to-end analysis of customer
behavior to identify engagement patterns, usage trends, and early
indicators of churn. By integrating user profile data, activity events,
and billing information, the project builds a unified analytical model
that tracks the customer journey from onboarding to inactivity.

The solution transforms raw operational data into actionable insights
through structured data modeling, lifecycle segmentation, and
interactive visual reporting. It demonstrates how businesses can monitor
customer health, understand engagement levels, and support retention
strategies using data-driven decision-making.

## Business Problem

Customer churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based
and digital product companies. Without visibility into user activity and
engagement, businesses cannot identify which customers are at risk of
leaving.

## Project Objectives

-   Build a centralized data model combining user, event, and billing
    data
-   Measure engagement through user activity tracking
-   Segment users into lifecycle categories (Active, At Risk, Dormant)
-   Identify early warning signs of churn risk
-   Design an interactive dashboard for business stakeholders

## Data Sources

**Users Data** - User ID - Country - Signup Date - Subscription Plan

**Events Data** - Event ID - User ID - Event Date - Event Type

**Billing Data** - Billing ID - User ID - Billing Date - Amount - Status

## Methodology

1.  Data Modeling using relationships across tables
2.  Feature Engineering using DAX (Last Activity Date, Lifecycle
    Segmentation)
3.  Dashboard Development with KPIs and interactive visuals

## Key Insights

-   Identify inactive users likely to churn
-   Compare engagement across plans and countries
-   Track activity trends over time
-   Monitor customer lifecycle health

## Tools Used

-   Power BI
-   DAX
-   Data Modeling
-   Data Visualization

## Outcome

A complete interactive churn intelligence dashboard that transforms raw
customer data into actionable business insights and demonstrates
job-ready data analyst skills.
